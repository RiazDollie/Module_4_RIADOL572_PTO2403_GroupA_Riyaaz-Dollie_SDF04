# [SDF04] CSS Magic Buttons

Project Goal:
Add Animations to buttons using CSS

Ideas:
I wanted to keep it simple and effortless, optimised my use of CSS in order to achieve this and stuck to a simple hover animation change.

All in all im just proud that my code worked and that i managed to make it somewhat appealing to the eyes
